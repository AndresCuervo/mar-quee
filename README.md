# `<mar-quee>`

This is a [web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) recreating the obsolete [`<marquee>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) element.

The point of a web component is that you can use it just like you would any other HTML tag.
For instance is you've included `<mar-quee>` in your page already then the following HTML:

```html
<mar-quee>marquee one</mar-quee>
<mar-quee>marquee one</mar-quee>
<mar-quee>marquee twoooooooooo</mar-quee>
```

will look like this:
